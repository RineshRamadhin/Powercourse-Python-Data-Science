# Powercourse Python Data Science
This repo contains a Python Jupyter notebook environment, 
datasets for data manipulation and notebooks explaining 
the basics of Jupyter notebook and Python data Science in general.

## Setup guide
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
    - Optional: Extend memory when working with large datasets.
3. Go to the project path and run `make start`.
4. Wait for the container to boot up and the following output to appear:
```
jupyter_1  |     To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
jupyter_1  |         file:///home/jovyan/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-7-open.html
